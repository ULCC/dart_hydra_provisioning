  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 3000

  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8984, host: 8984
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 6379, host: 6379

  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # your network.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

     vb.cpus = 1
  end

  # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
